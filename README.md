# Pulsar Detection Project

## To run deployment:
```bash
git clone 

# Without Docker - deploy commands

pip install -r requirements.txt 
python deploy/api-app.py modeling/best_xgboost_model.pkl

# With Docker
docker build -t pulsar-fastapi-app .
docker run -d -p 5000:5000 -p 18000:18000 pulsar-fastapi-app

# Monitoring 
./node_exporter --web.listen-address=:9200 &
"$PATHTOPROMETHEUSBINARY$" --config.file=deploy/prometheus.yml
```
## Problem

Pulsars are a type of neutron star that emit beams of electromagnetic radiation. Detecting pulsars is a significant challenge in the field of astronomy due to their sparse occurrence and the presence of a vast amount of noise in the data. Efficiently processing and analyzing large datasets to identify these celestial objects requires robust data processing and machine learning techniques.

## File Structure

This project is organized into several key directories and files to facilitate data acquisition, processing, and modeling.

```bash

```

### Detailed Descriptions

#### download/

This directory contains the Airflow DAG script `pulsar_data_download.py` which automates the process of downloading the latest pulsar data. The downloaded data is stored in the `data/` subdirectory.

**Files:**

- dags/pulsar_data_download `.py `: An Airflow DAG to schedule and automate data fetching tasks.

**Usage:**

1. Ensure Airflow is properly installed and configured.
2. Place the `pulsar_data_download.py` script in the Airflow DAGs directory.
3. Start the Airflow scheduler to begin fetching data periodically.

#### modeling/

This directory is dedicated to building and training machine learning models to predict pulsars. The main script `getmodel_mlflow.py` utilizes MLflow for tracking experiments and model management.

**Files:**

- `getmodel_mlflow .py `: A script to train various machine learning models for pulsar detection.
- `models/`: A directory to store trained models.

**Usage:**

1. Ensure MLflow is installed and configured.
2. Run the `getmodel_mlflow `.py ` script to start training models.
3. Use MLflow UI to track and manage experiments.

#### pulsar_processing.py

This standalone script is responsible for data processing using Apache Beam. It reads the raw pulsar data, performs cleaning, feature engineering, and prepares the data for modeling.

#### Deploy
The fastapi app code is in `api-app.py` file. The deployment can be ran by running the docker file.

```bash
docker build -t pulsar-fastapi-app 
docker run -d -p 5000:5000 -p 18000:18000 pulsar-fastapi-app
```

**Usage:**

1. Ensure Apache Beam is installed.
2. Run the `pulsar_processing.py` script to process the data.

   ```sh
   python pulsar_processing.py
   ```
